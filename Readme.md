# Health Monitoring AV:
Intelligent monitoring of human health conditions during autonomous car-sharing services.
  It employes sensors able to detect possible anomalies in passengers health values. Possibility to take vital choices for increasing surviving chances for passengers. 
  Equip the vehicle with the ability to automatically contact emergency services and provide real-time data (location, passenger health status, etc.) in case of an accident or medical emergency.
  Analysis and report on the environmental situation inside the cabin.

## Functions
- IR fever detection
- Camera
- Possible FER for disease recognition
- Heart-beat analysis.

# Alternative Ideas
## Second idea:
- Intelligent vehicle adjustments for personal use. (Seats, environment temperature, lights, music and content delivery)
- Automatic scheduling of paths based on the user history/habits. In addition, possibility to customize the route for limiting cases.
- Implement a system that learns and adapts to the preferences and habits of different users over time, providing a more personalized and efficient driving experience.
## Possibile third idea:
- Develop advanced security measures such as biometric authentication, real-time monitoring of the vehicle's surroundings, and automatic threat detection to ensure passenger safety.
## Possible fourth idea: 
- Implement a system that uses machine learning to predict and prevent potential vehicle failures by analyzing data from various sensors and historical maintenance records.
